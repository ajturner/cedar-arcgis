# cedar-arcgis

This repository is the prototype for converting ArcGIS Cedar definitions into ArcGIS Charts. 

Cedar is a project developed in 2015 to provide a simple developer interface for creating charts from ArcGIS data. It is used in ArcGIS Hub and other customer projects. 

Cedar uses a very simple configuration file with defaults for other options such as colors, fonts, etc. 

The converter.ts script is an initial conversion with more work necessary to support all chart types and overrides.

## Developer

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. open http://localhost:3333/ and http://localhost:3333/examples.html
